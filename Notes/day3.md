# Key Takeaways: JWT, RSA, Key Rotation, HMAC, and More

## Overview

In today’s discussion, we covered several important concepts related to JWT authentication, including:
- **Signing Methods** (RSA, HMAC, ECDSA)
- **JWT Generation and Verification**
- **Public and Private Keys** for secure token handling
- **Key Rotation** and why it’s important
- **Access Tokens** vs **Refresh Tokens**

## 1. **What is JWT?**
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. It is used for securely transmitting information between client and server, especially for **authentication and authorization**.

### **JWT Structure**:
- **Header**: Metadata (e.g., signing algorithm, token type).
- **Payload**: Claims (data like user information, roles, etc.).
- **Signature**: Ensures the token hasn’t been tampered with.

## 2. **JWT Signing Methods**
JWT supports various signing methods, which can be categorized as **symmetric** (HMAC) or **asymmetric** (RSA, ECDSA).

### **Asymmetric Algorithms (RSA, ECDSA)**:
- **Private Key**: Used for **signing** the JWT (should be kept **secure**).
- **Public Key**: Used for **verifying** the JWT (can be shared **publicly**).

**Advantages**:
- **Public/Private Key pair** provides more **security**.
- **Key Rotation** is possible without affecting the client (public key can be shared, private key remains secret).

### **Symmetric Algorithm (HMAC)**:
- **Shared Secret Key**: Both used for **signing** and **verifying** the JWT.
- **Not as secure** as asymmetric methods, since the same key is used for both signing and verifying.

## 3. **Access Token vs Refresh Token**
- **Access Token**: 
  - Short-lived (e.g., expires in 15 minutes to 1 hour).
  - Used for **accessing protected resources**.
- **Refresh Token**:
  - Long-lived (e.g., expires in weeks or months).
  - Used to **obtain a new access token** after the current one expires.

### **Flow**:
1. User logs in, server generates an **access token** and a **refresh token**.
2. **Access token** is sent in the request header for authenticated API calls.
3. When the **access token** expires, the **refresh token** is used to generate a new **access token** without requiring the user to log in again.

## 4. **Key Rotation**
Key rotation is the process of periodically changing your **private/public key pair** to enhance security.

### **Key Rotation Process**:
1. When a new key pair is generated, the **private key** is used for signing JWTs.
2. The **public key** is shared via JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) so clients can verify the JWT signatures.
3. Clients use the **public key** to verify the JWT signed with the **private key**.

### **Why Key Rotation is Important**:
- **Security**: If a private key is compromised, rotating keys ensures that old tokens are no longer valid.
- **Regulation**: Some security standards require key rotation after a certain period of time.

## 5. **RSA Key Pair**
RSA is one of the most commonly used **asymmetric algorithms**. It uses two keys:
- **Private Key**: Used to **sign** the JWT.
- **Public Key**: Used to **verify** the JWT.

The public key is shared with the clients so they can verify the JWT signature, while the private key is securely kept on the server.

---

## 6. **HMAC (HS256)**
- **HMAC** is a **symmetric** algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both signing and verifying the JWT.
- It’s simpler and faster but **less secure** compared to RSA or ECDSA, as both parties need access to the **shared secret key**.

---

## 7. **JWT Parsing and Verification**
In JWT parsing and verification:
1. **JWT is passed to `jwt.Parse()`**.
2. The **callback function** is called with the parsed **token object** (`t`), which contains the decoded **header**, **payload**, and **signature**.
3. **Verification** is done using the **public key** to ensure the signature matches, ensuring the token was not tampered with.

---

## **Next Steps:**
- **Implement Refresh Tokens**: Add logic for refreshing expired tokens using the refresh token.
- **Key Rotation**: Ensure keys are rotated securely, and old tokens signed with previous keys are still verified using the old keys.
- **Frontend Integration**: Store and manage JWTs on the client side (local storage, cookies, etc.).
- **Testing**: Test the full flow of token creation, validation, and expiration.

---

## **Conclusion:**
In this project, we’ve covered key concepts like JWT creation, signing and verification, key rotation, and the difference between access tokens and refresh tokens. The next steps will involve implementing refresh token handling and further securing the application.
